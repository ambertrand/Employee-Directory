## Developer Notes:
For this project I was tasked with creating a employee directory with React that could allow the user to filter by name & email as well as sort acending and descending alphabetically.

Starting out I was able to get my modules built out but I struggled with getting the data from the API to render in the table.  After some help from a classmate I was able to finally get the data showing on the table.  My next challenge was trying to get the sort and filter functions working.  After some help from Material-UI and React docs I was able to get the functions working and a successful project.
